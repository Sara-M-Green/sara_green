Upon joining our engineering team, Sara rapidly dug into our ecom/backend stack and took over key feature / component development. She is a highly skilled, flexible and growth oriented software engineer. Super diligent, always reliable with a high level of solution oriented and always positive 'I-will-figure-it-out' attitude. She was highly respected by her peers. We would rehire Sara in a heart beat and any team will be lucky to have her!",

In that time, I was constantly struck by her willingness to learn, how quickly she picked up new skills, and how good-natured she is. Her role in the time I worked with her morphed from a junior front-end developer to a mid-level full-stack engineer, largely because she wasn’t afraid to tackle whatever was thrown her way. Early-on it was easy to recognize that she was willing and capable and that never changed in her tenure. I never heard her say no to anything new.She wasn’t afraid to ask for or offer help. And she became our resident expert on many-a-subject. Whether it was learning a new framework, re-structuring components, or deciphering ancient code relics, Sara was a rock-star. She is kind, funny, and easy-going and has become a dear friend. I loved working with Sara. And I genuinely hope I get the chance to work with her again some day.",
